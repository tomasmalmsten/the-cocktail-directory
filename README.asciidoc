The Cocktail Directory - README
-------------------------------

The Cocktail Directory offers the user the ability to, like a very good bartender with a
long list of recepies at hand, find the perfect drink for the occation by searching based
on a number of properties.


Introduction
-------------

The idea of The Cocktail Directory came to me when I understood the power of
graph databases, especially Neo4J, and was chalanged with finding the best
cocktail for a specific occation with limited resources in the bar. Imagine 
if I could create a tool that would allow me to at least be close to as good
as the bartender at Milk & Honey in NYC who managed to pick out exactly what
I wanted by just asking me for one spirit and two flavors. So that is the
aim with this project.
